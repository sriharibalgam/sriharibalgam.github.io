### DevOps
    It is a practice of agility in development and operations
    DevOps is a Software Development approach which involves Continuous Dev, testing, integration, deployment and monitoring of the software throughout its development lifecycle.

    # Collaboration of Development and Operations with the use of Automation tools.

    -- Reduce Rework
    -- Overhead

    Make use of tool to automate the process.

### Dark Launching Technique
    Continuous development
    Continuous Testing 
    constinuous in Integration
    Continuous Deployment 
    Continuous Monitoring

### Framework
    A particular implementation of a web application, where your code fills in the details. The framework is in charge, and it calls into your code when it needs something application-specific. E.g., AngularJS, Durandal, Ember.js, etc.
